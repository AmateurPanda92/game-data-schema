# AmateurPanda92 Game Data Schema

A TypeScript data model and JSON schema for encapsulating game data, with a focus on flexibility and human readability.

_**Note:** The schema is currently unstable, as the initial version is being developed alongside the [Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Game Boy Color port project](https://www.github.com/AmateurPanda92/sonic-1-gbc), so is liable to have regular breaking changes as and when that projectâ€™s needs evolve._
